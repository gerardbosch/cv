LaTeX source for my CV.

[Click here](http://gerardbosch.github.io/cv) to see the up to date PDF version.

ðŸ‘† The PDF is build and published on GitHup Pages using GitHub Actions :)

# How to build

To do a local build of the TEX you need a Texlive distribution with all the required packages (full-installation just
to be sure).
Then:

```
pdflatex main.tex
```

That's it!
